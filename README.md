- Use XML for UI layout.
- Use Activities as main containers.
- Use Fragments for feature screens.
- Use RecyclerView Adapters for list screens.
- Use Model classes for data objects.
- Use Repository classes for Firebase or data operations.
- Do not write heavy data logic directly inside Activity or Fragment.
- Use meaningful file names such as `EventAdapter.java`, `User.java`, and `HomeFragment.java`.
- Keep Firebase collection names in `FirebaseCollections.java`.
- Keep app constants in `Constants.java`.
